1. What is DVWA?

DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) is an intentionally insecure web application created for learning and practicing web application security.

Purpose of DVWA

DVWA is designed to help:

Students learn common web vulnerabilities

Practice ethical hacking and penetration testing

Understand how vulnerabilities work and how to fix them

DVWA should only be used in a legal lab environment, never on real or public systems.

2. Technologies Used in DVWA

DVWA is built using:

PHP – server-side scripting

MySQL / MariaDB – database

Apache / Nginx – web server

Because of this, DVWA is commonly run using:

XAMPP / WAMP / LAMP

Docker

Virtual Machines (Kali Linux, Ubuntu, etc.)

3. Vulnerabilities Covered in DVWA

DVWA includes hands-on labs for major OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, such as:

SQL Injection (SQLi)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Command Injection

File Inclusion (LFI / RFI)

Brute Force Attacks

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

File Upload Vulnerabilities

Insecure CAPTCHA

Weak Session Management

Each vulnerability has security levels:

Low

Medium

High

Impossible

This helps users see how defenses improve security.

4. Lab Setup Overview
System Requirements

Operating System: Linux / Windows / macOS

Web Server: Apache

Database: MySQL or MariaDB

PHP (compatible version)

Browser (Firefox or Chrome recommended)

5. DVWA Installation Steps (Example: XAMPP)
Step 1: Install XAMPP

Download and install XAMPP

Start Apache and MySQL

Step 2: Download DVWA

Clone or download DVWA from GitHub

Place it inside the web server directory:

htdocs/dvwa

Step 3: Configure DVWA

Rename config.inc.php.dist to config.inc.php

Set database credentials:

Username: root

Password: (empty by default in XAMPP)

Step 4: Create Database

Open browser:

http://localhost/phpmyadmin


Create a database named:

dvwa

Step 5: Initialize DVWA

Open:

http://localhost/dvwa/setup.php


Click Create / Reset Database

6. Default Login Credentials
Username: admin
Password: password


After login:

Go to DVWA Security

Set security level to Low for beginners

7. Lab Usage Guidelines

Perform attacks only inside DVWA

Change security levels to understand protection mechanisms

Document:

Vulnerability

Attack method

Impact

Mitigation

This is useful for lab reports and GitHub documentation.

8. Ethical and Legal Notice

DVWA is for:

Education

Practice

Ethical hacking labs

Don't Using these techniques on real systems without permission is illegal.
