Day 1 – White-Hat Hacking Fundamentals

100 Days Hacking Challenge

1. What is Hacking (Real Meaning)

Hacking is the process of understanding how systems work and identifying weaknesses in them.
Ethical (white-hat) hacking focuses on finding and fixing vulnerabilities legally, not exploiting them for personal gain.

Example:
A company hires a security tester to check whether its website can be hacked before attackers find the weakness.

2. White-Hat Hacking

White-hat hackers are authorized security professionals who test systems legally and ethically. They follow rules, permissions, and responsible disclosure policies.

Why it matters:
Without white-hat hackers, organizations would not know their security weaknesses until criminals exploit them.

Example:
A security researcher reports a login bypass bug to a company instead of misusing it.

3. Bug Bounty Hunting

Bug bounty hunting is a program where companies allow ethical hackers to find vulnerabilities in their systems and report them responsibly. In return, companies may offer rewards or recognition.

Key Points:

Legal and permission-based

Scope is clearly defined

Focuses on reporting, not exploiting

Example:
Finding an SQL injection vulnerability in a website’s search feature and reporting it through the company’s bug bounty platform.

4. Penetration Testing

Penetration testing (pentesting) is a structured security assessment where testers simulate real-world attacks under controlled conditions to evaluate system security.

How it differs from random attacks:

Penetration Testing	Random Attacks
Authorized	Unauthorized
Planned & scoped	Unplanned
Documented results	No reporting
Improves security	Causes damage

Example:
Testing whether an internal company server can be accessed without proper authentication.

5. Computer Networking

Computer networking explains how devices communicate with each other using wired or wireless connections. It involves data transfer, protocols, addressing, and routing.

Why networking is important in hacking:
Every cyber attack happens over a network. Without networking knowledge, it is impossible to understand attacks or defenses.

Example:
A laptop sending a request to a website server using the internet.

6. Client–Server Architecture

Client–server architecture is a model where:

Client requests a service

Server processes the request and sends a response

Roles:

Client: Browser, mobile app

Server: Web server, database server

Example:
When you open Instagram:

Your phone = Client

Instagram servers = Server

7. What is a Server

A server is a powerful computer designed to provide services, data, or resources to other devices (clients).

Difference between PC and Server:

Server runs 24/7

Handles multiple users

Stores and processes large amounts of data

Example:
A server hosting a website that thousands of users access simultaneously.

8. Types of Servers

Different servers perform different tasks:

a) Web Server

Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests and delivers web pages.

Example:
Apache or Nginx serving a website.

b) Application Server

Processes application logic and business rules.

Example:
Handling user login validation in a web app.

c) Database Server

Stores and manages data.

Example:
MySQL storing user credentials and posts.

d) File Server

Stores and shares files across a network.

Example:
Company file storage accessible to employees.

9. Data Packets

Data sent over a network is broken into small units called packets. Each packet travels independently and is reassembled at the destination.

Why packets are important:
Attackers and defenders analyze packets to detect suspicious activity.

Example:
Sending a message on WhatsApp:

Message is split into packets

Packets travel through different routes

Reassembled on the receiver’s phone

10. How Data Travels Over a Network

Client sends request

Data is divided into packets

Packets travel through routers and switches

Server receives and processes request

Response packets return to client

Example:
Opening a website URL in a browser.

11. Cybercrime Investigators

Cybercrime investigators analyze digital evidence to track cybercriminals. They rely heavily on networking, server logs, and packet analysis.

Example:
Tracing an attacker's IP address using server logs.

12. Security Professionals

Security professionals design, monitor, and improve system security. They use tools only after understanding the underlying systems.

Key Skills Needed Before Tools:

- Networking

- System architecture

- Protocols

- Ethics
13. Types of Hackers

Hackers are commonly categorized based on intent, authorization, and ethical approach. Understanding these types helps distinguish between legal security work and cybercrime.

1) White-Hat Hackers (Ethical Hackers)

White-hat hackers are authorized security professionals who legally test systems to identify and fix vulnerabilities. They follow laws, permissions, and ethical standards.

Key Characteristics:

Legal and permission-based

Focus on defense and security improvement

Follow responsible disclosure

Example:
A company hires a penetration tester to assess its website security and submit a detailed vulnerability report.

1) Black-Hat Hackers (Malicious Hackers)

Black-hat hackers illegally exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain, damage, or data theft. Their activities are criminal and harmful.

Key Characteristics:

No authorization

Illegal actions

Intent to steal, damage, or disrupt

Example:
Stealing customer credit card details from an unsecured e-commerce website.

3️⃣ Gray-Hat Hackers

Gray-hat hackers fall between white-hat and black-hat hackers. They may discover vulnerabilities without permission but usually do not intend harm. However, their actions can still be illegal.

Key Characteristics:

No official permission

Mixed intentions

Ethical boundaries unclear

Example:
Finding a vulnerability in a website without permission and notifying the owner without exploiting it.

4️⃣ Script Kiddies

Script kiddies are beginners who use pre-written tools or scripts without understanding how they work. They rely on automation rather than technical knowledge.

Key Characteristics:

Limited technical understanding

Use publicly available tools

Often cause unintended damage

Example:
Running a DDoS tool downloaded from the internet without knowing how the attack works.

5️⃣ Hacktivists

Hacktivists use hacking techniques to promote political, social, or ideological causes. Their actions are often illegal even if motivated by beliefs.

Key Characteristics:

Ideology-driven

Targets governments or organizations

Public exposure of data

Example:
Defacing a government website to protest a policy.

6️⃣ Insider Threats

Insider threats are individuals within an organization who misuse their access intentionally or unintentionally.

Key Characteristics:

Authorized access

High impact due to trust level

Difficult to detect

Example:
An employee leaking confidential company data.

7️⃣ Cyber Terrorists

Cyber terrorists aim to create fear, disruption, or large-scale damage by attacking critical infrastructure such as power grids, healthcare systems, or financial institutions.

Key Characteristics:

Large-scale impact

Targets critical systems

Politically or ideologically motivated

Example:
Attacking a hospital network to disrupt emergency services.
