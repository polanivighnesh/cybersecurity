Day 41 – Server Setup and Project Deployment
Introduction

In modern web development and cybersecurity, understanding how servers work is essential. Developers usually create and test applications in a local server environment before deploying them to public servers where users can access them globally. This learning focused on setting up local servers using XAMPP, understanding different server stacks such as WAMP and LAMP, and learning the step-by-step process of deploying applications to public hosting servers.

What is a Server?

A server is a system that provides services, resources, or data to other systems known as clients over a network. In web development, a server stores website files, processes backend code, manages databases, and delivers responses to users through browsers.

Servers mainly perform:

Hosting website files

Processing backend logic

Managing database operations

Handling client requests and responses

Managing authentication and session control

Local Server Environment

A local server is a server that runs on a developer’s own computer. It is mainly used for development and testing before deployment.

Benefits of Local Servers

Safe testing environment

Faster development and debugging

No need for internet hosting during development

Easy configuration and modification

Reduces risk of exposing incomplete applications

XAMPP Server

XAMPP is a cross-platform local server package used for web development.

Components of XAMPP

X – Cross Platform
A – Apache Server
M – MySQL (Database Server)
P – PHP
P – Perl

Features

Simple installation and configuration

Supports multiple programming languages

Includes database management using phpMyAdmin

Provides Apache server for running websites locally

Useful for beginners and professional developers

Basic Setup Steps

Download XAMPP from the official website.

Install the application and launch the control panel.

Start Apache and MySQL services.

Place project files inside the htdocs folder.

Access the project using:

http://localhost/project-name

Types of Server Stacks
WAMP

W – Windows
A – Apache
M – MySQL
P – PHP

Used specifically on Windows operating systems.

LAMP

L – Linux
A – Apache
M – MySQL
P – PHP

Widely used in production servers because Linux offers strong performance and stability.

MAMP

M – macOS
A – Apache
M – MySQL
P – PHP

Used for macOS development environments.

Difference Between Local Server and Public Server
Local Server

Runs on personal computer

Used for development and testing

Accessible only locally

Faster debugging and experimentation

Public Server

Hosted on internet infrastructure

Accessible globally

Used for production deployment

Requires hosting and domain configuration

Project Deployment to Public Servers

Deployment is the process of making an application available on the internet for public use.

Step 1 – Choose a Hosting Provider

Hosting providers supply server infrastructure for storing and running web applications.

Types of Hosting

Shared Hosting

VPS Hosting

Dedicated Hosting

Cloud Hosting

Factors to Consider

Performance and speed

Security features

Scalability

Customer support

Pricing

Step 2 – Register a Domain Name

A domain name is the public address of a website.

Example:

www.example.com


The domain must be linked to the hosting server through DNS configuration.

Step 3 – Configure Server Environment

Server configuration includes:

Setting up runtime environments

Configuring FTP or SSH access

Setting file permissions

Configuring server ports

Installing required dependencies

Step 4 – Upload Website Files

Website files must be transferred from local machine to the hosting server.

Methods

FTP Clients (FileZilla, WinSCP)

Git-based deployment

Hosting control panel file managers

Files are typically uploaded into:

public_html


or

www


directory

Step 5 – Setup and Configure Database

Database deployment involves:

Creating database in hosting panel

Importing local database using SQL dump

Updating database connection credentials in project files

Testing database connectivity

Step 6 – Testing and Launching the Website

Before going live:

Verify all pages load correctly

Test database operations

Check authentication and sessions

Validate file upload functionality

Confirm API and backend services

Perform security checks

After successful testing, the website becomes publicly accessible.

Security Considerations During Deployment

Use strong database credentials

Disable debugging mode in production

Secure configuration files

Implement HTTPS using SSL certificates

Restrict file permissions

Regularly update dependencies and server software

Monitor logs and server activities

Importance in Cybersecurity

Understanding server deployment helps security professionals:

Identify server misconfigurations

Detect exposed services and ports

Analyze web application attack surfaces

Improve infrastructure security

Perform vulnerability assessments

Conclusion

Learning server setup and deployment bridges the gap between development and real-world production environments. XAMPP and other server stacks help developers build and test applications locally, while deployment knowledge ensures applications can run securely and efficiently on public servers. Mastering server environments is a crucial skill for both developers and cybersecurity professionals.
