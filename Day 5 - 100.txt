Day 5 – Server Vulnerabilities vs Website Vulnerabilities
Introduction

A website may appear secure to users, but security depends on two different layers:

The server where the website is hosted

The website application itself

Understanding the difference between server vulnerabilities and website vulnerabilities is critical in real-world security assessments.

What Are Server Vulnerabilities

Server vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the infrastructure or system that hosts one or more websites. These vulnerabilities affect the entire server, not just a single website.

Common Server Vulnerabilities
Unpatched Operating System or Software

Servers running outdated operating systems, web servers, or services contain known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

Example:
A Linux server running an old Apache version is vulnerable to a known remote code execution flaw.

Impact:
All websites hosted on that server are at risk.

Weak or Default Credentials

Servers using weak passwords or default login credentials are vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

Example:
SSH login protected with a simple password instead of key-based authentication.

Impact:
Once the attacker gains server access, all hosted websites can be compromised.

Misconfigured Server Settings

Improper configurations expose sensitive services or files.

Examples:
Directory listing enabled
Admin panels publicly accessible
Debug mode enabled in production

Impact:
Attackers gain unauthorized access to server resources.

Open and Unnecessary Ports

Servers running unnecessary services expose additional attack surfaces.

Example:
FTP, database ports, or admin services open to the internet.

Impact:
Attackers can scan and exploit exposed services.

No Firewall or WAF

Servers without firewalls or Web Application Firewalls do not filter malicious traffic.

Example:
No protection against automated scanning, brute-force attacks, or injection attempts.

Impact:
Higher risk of mass exploitation.

Shared Hosting Environment

Multiple websites share the same server resources.

Example:
One vulnerable website allows an attacker to upload malicious files and pivot to other sites.

Impact:
One compromised website can affect many others.

What Are Website Vulnerabilities

Website vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the web application code or logic. These usually affect only that specific website, not the entire server.

Common Website Vulnerabilities
SQL Injection

Occurs when user input is not properly validated before being used in database queries.

Example:
Login form allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries and bypass authentication.

Impact:
Database data theft or modification.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Occurs when user input is displayed without proper sanitization.

Example:
Malicious scripts injected into comment sections.

Impact:
Session hijacking or user redirection.

Broken Authentication

Occurs when login mechanisms are improperly implemented.

Example:
Session IDs not expiring after logout.

Impact:
Attackers impersonate legitimate users.

Insecure File Upload

Occurs when file uploads are not properly validated.

Example:
Uploading a malicious script instead of an image.

Impact:
Website defacement or code execution.

Broken Access Control

Occurs when users can access resources they should not.

Example:
Normal users accessing admin pages by changing URLs.

Impact:
Privilege escalation.

Exposed Sensitive Data

Occurs when sensitive information is stored or transmitted insecurely.

Example:
Plaintext passwords or exposed configuration files.

Impact:
Data leaks and privacy violations.

Key Differences Between Server and Website Vulnerabilities
Aspect	Server Vulnerabilities	Website Vulnerabilities
Scope	Affects entire server	Affects one website
Impact	Multiple websites compromised	Single website compromised
Cause	OS, services, configurations	Application code flaws
Example	Unpatched Apache server	SQL injection in login form
Risk Level	High impact	Medium to high impact
Real-World Scenario Example

A company hosts three websites on a single shared server.

Website A has an insecure file upload vulnerability.
An attacker uploads a malicious script and gains limited server access.
The server has outdated software and no proper isolation.

Result:
The attacker moves laterally and compromises Website B and Website C.

This attack happened because of:

Website vulnerability (insecure file upload)

Server vulnerability (shared hosting, outdated software)

How Security Should Be Approached

Website security alone is not enough.
Server security alone is not enough.

Both must work together.

Secure servers require:

Regular patching

Strong authentication

Proper configurations

Firewalls and monitoring

Secure websites require:

Secure coding practices

Input validation

Proper authentication

Access control
