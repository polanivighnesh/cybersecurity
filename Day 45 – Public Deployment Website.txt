Day 45 – Public Deployment Website Servers
Introduction

Public deployment website servers are platforms that allow developers to host and run their applications on the internet so users can access them globally. Deployment is the process of transferring an application from a local development environment to a live server.

These servers provide infrastructure, storage, security, scalability, and networking capabilities required to make applications publicly accessible.

Why Public Deployment Servers Are Important

Make applications accessible worldwide

Provide reliable hosting infrastructure

Offer scalability for handling large traffic

Ensure security through SSL and authentication tools

Support automation and continuous deployment

Enable monitoring and performance optimization
