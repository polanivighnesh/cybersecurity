Day 24 – PHP Basics
Variables, Operators & Conditional Statements
1. What is PHP?

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language mainly used for web development.
It runs on the server and generates dynamic web pages.

Why PHP?

Easy to learn

Widely used for backend development

Works well with HTML & databases (MySQL)

2. PHP Variables
What is a Variable?

A variable is a container used to store data that can be reused and modified.

Rules for PHP Variables

Must start with $

Cannot start with a number

Case-sensitive

No spaces allowed

Example:
<?php
$name = "John";
$age = 25;
$isAdmin = true;

echo $name;
echo $age;
?>

Variable Types
<?php
$text = "Hello";      // String
$number = 10;         // Integer
$price = 99.99;       // Float
$status = true;       // Boolean
?>

3. PHP Operators
What are Operators?

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.

3.1 Arithmetic Operators

Used for mathematical calculations.

Operator	Meaning
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
/	Division
%	Modulus

Example:

<?php
$a = 10;
$b = 5;

echo $a + $b; // 15
echo $a * $b; // 50
?>

3.2 Assignment Operators

Used to assign values.

<?php
$x = 10;
$x += 5;   // $x = $x + 5
echo $x;   // 15
?>

3.3 Comparison Operators

Used to compare values.

Operator	Meaning
==	Equal
!=	Not Equal
>	Greater Than
<	Less Than
>=	Greater or Equal
<=	Less or Equal

Example:

<?php
$a = 10;
$b = 5;

var_dump($a > $b);  // true
?>

3.4 Logical Operators

Used to combine conditions.

Operator	Meaning
&&	AND
	
!	NOT

Example:

<?php
$age = 20;

if ($age > 18 && $age < 60) {
    echo "Eligible";
}
?>

4. Conditional Statements
What are Conditions?

Conditional statements control the flow of execution based on conditions.

4.1 if Statement
<?php
$score = 80;

if ($score >= 50) {
    echo "Pass";
}
?>

4.2 if–else Statement
<?php
$score = 40;

if ($score >= 50) {
    echo "Pass";
} else {
    echo "Fail";
}
?>

4.3 if–else if–else Statement
<?php
$marks = 85;

if ($marks >= 90) {
    echo "Excellent";
} elseif ($marks >= 60) {
    echo "Good";
} else {
    echo "Needs Improvement";
}
?>

5. Real-World Example (Login Logic)
<?php
$username = "admin";
$password = "1234";

if ($username == "admin" && $password == "1234") {
    echo "Login Successful";
} else {
    echo "Invalid Credentials";
}
?>

6. Key Takeaways

Variables store data

Operators perform actions on data

Conditions control program flow
