Day 39 – Authorization Bypass & Privilege Escalation
1. Introduction

Authorization bypass is a critical security flaw where an application fails to properly enforce access controls. When authorization checks are weak, missing, or incorrectly implemented, an attacker can access resources or actions beyond their intended permission level.
This often leads to privilege escalation, where a low-privileged user gains higher privileges such as admin or system-level access.

2. Authorization vs Authentication
Authentication

Confirms who the user is

Example: Login using username and password

Authorization

Determines what the user is allowed to do

Example: Whether a logged-in user can access admin features

Authorization bypass occurs after authentication, when access rules are not properly validated.

3. What Is Authorization Bypass?

Authorization bypass happens when:

Role-based access checks are missing

Permissions are enforced only on the client side

Backend APIs do not validate user roles properly

Sensitive endpoints rely on predictable parameters

As a result, a normal user may access restricted functionality without proper permissions.

4. Privilege Escalation Explained

Privilege escalation is the outcome of authorization bypass where an attacker:

Moves from low-level access to higher privileges

Gains permissions not originally assigned

Achieves control over sensitive system functionality

Types of Privilege Escalation

Horizontal Privilege Escalation
Accessing another user’s data with the same privilege level

Vertical Privilege Escalation
Gaining higher privileges such as admin or superuser

5. Common Causes

Missing authorization checks on backend endpoints

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

Role validation performed only in frontend code

Misconfigured access control lists (ACLs)

Over-privileged user roles

Trusting user-controlled input for role or permission decisions

6. Impact and Severity

Authorization bypass leading to privilege escalation can result in:

Full system compromise

Unauthorized access to sensitive data

Data manipulation or deletion

Account takeover

Business logic abuse

Compliance and legal violations

This vulnerability is considered high to critical severity in most systems.

7. Detection and Testing (Defensive Perspective)

Security testers and developers should:

Test all endpoints with different user roles

Verify backend authorization independently of frontend

Attempt accessing restricted resources as a low-privileged user

Review access control logic during code reviews

Log and monitor unauthorized access attempts

8. Prevention and Mitigation
Strong Access Control

Enforce authorization checks on the server side

Use centralized access control mechanisms

Principle of Least Privilege

Grant users only the permissions they need

Avoid default admin-level permissions

Secure API Design

Validate user roles for every sensitive request

Avoid exposing internal object identifiers

Defense-in-Depth

Combine authentication, authorization, logging, and monitoring

Regular security audits and penetration testing

9. Key Takeaways

Authorization bypass is more dangerous than authentication flaws

Privilege escalation often results from poor access control design

Backend validation is mandatory for secure systems

Proper authorization protects data, users, and infrastructure

Understanding this vulnerability is essential for secure application development
