Day 53 – Broken Access Control
1. What is Broken Access Control?

Broken Access Control occurs when an application fails to properly enforce restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do.

Access control ensures that users can only:

Access data they are authorized to view

Perform actions they are permitted to execute

Modify resources they own

When these checks are missing, weak, or improperly implemented, attackers can exploit the system to gain unauthorized access.

According to OWASP Top 10, Broken Access Control is one of the most critical web application vulnerabilities.

2. Types of Access Control
2.1 Vertical Access Control

Prevents users from performing actions reserved for higher privilege roles.

Example:

A normal user accessing /admin/dashboard

A user modifying role=admin in a request

If the server does not verify roles properly, privilege escalation occurs.

2.2 Horizontal Access Control

Prevents users from accessing other users’ resources.

Example:

User A accessing:
GET /api/orders/123

Changing ID to:
GET /api/orders/124

If order 124 belongs to another user and is still accessible, this is an IDOR vulnerability.

2.3 Context-Dependent Access Control

Prevents users from performing actions outside allowed workflow.

Example:

Accessing payment confirmation before completing payment

Bypassing multi-step verification processes

3. Common Broken Access Control Vulnerabilities

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Privilege escalation

Forced browsing

Missing role validation

Insecure API endpoint exposure

JWT manipulation

Parameter tampering

4. Tools Used for Testing Broken Access Control
4.1 Burp Suite

Used to intercept and modify HTTP requests.

How it helps:

Change user IDs

Modify roles in requests

Replay requests as different users

Analyze session tokens

Key Features:

Proxy

Repeater

Intruder

Decoder

4.2 OWASP ZAP

Open-source web vulnerability scanner.

How it helps:

Automated scanning

Manual request modification

Detecting access control misconfigurations

4.3 Postman

API testing tool.

How it helps:

Send requests with different user tokens

Test role-based access controls

Verify authorization headers

Example:
Test same endpoint with:

User token

Admin token

No token

Compare responses.

4.4 Acunetix

Automated web vulnerability scanner.

How it helps:

Identifies IDOR

Detects missing access controls

Scans API endpoints

4.5 JWT Toolkit

Used to analyze and manipulate JSON Web Tokens.

How it helps:

Decode JWT

Modify payload

Test algorithm confusion

Check signature validation

Example attack:
Change role from "user" to "admin" and re-sign or remove signature.

If accepted → Access control failure.

5. Practical Testing Methodology

Step 1: Identify endpoints

/admin

/api/users

/profile?id=1001

Step 2: Intercept requests
Use Burp Suite proxy.

Step 3: Modify parameters

Change user ID

Change role

Remove authorization header

Step 4: Observe server response

200 OK → Vulnerable

403 Forbidden → Secure

Step 5: Test with different user accounts
Compare access levels.

6. Root Causes of Broken Access Control

Access control checks only on frontend

No server-side role validation

Predictable resource IDs

Insecure direct object references

Weak session management

Improper JWT validation

7. Prevention Techniques

Enforce access control on server side

Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Use Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

Validate ownership of resources

Implement deny-by-default policy

Use indirect object references

Properly validate JWT signatures

Log and monitor access control failures

8. Real-World Impact

Broken access control can lead to:

Data breaches

Account takeover

Financial loss

Regulatory violations

Reputation damage

Many large-scale breaches occurred due to IDOR and privilege escalation flaws.

9. Key Learning Outcome – Day 53

Today I learned that:

Authentication is not enough; authorization is critical.

Access control must be enforced on the server.

Testing requires both manual and automated approaches.

Even small misconfigurations can expose sensitive data.

Understanding Broken Access Control is essential for becoming a skilled penetration tester and secure application developer.
