Day 43 – Understanding Ransomware Attacks and Detecting System Compromise
Introduction

Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to block access to systems or encrypt sensitive data until a ransom is paid. It is one of the most financially damaging and rapidly growing cyber threats affecting individuals, businesses, and government organizations worldwide.

Understanding ransomware is important not only for cybersecurity professionals but also for general users because early detection can prevent data loss, financial damage, and operational disruption.

What is Ransomware

Ransomware is a form of malware that encrypts files or locks a system and demands payment from the victim in exchange for restoring access. Attackers usually demand ransom payments in cryptocurrency to remain anonymous.

Primary Objectives of Ransomware

Encrypt user or organizational data

Deny access to systems or files

Force victims to pay ransom

Steal sensitive data for extortion (Double Extortion Attacks)

Common Types of Ransomware
1. Crypto Ransomware

Encrypts files and prevents access until payment is made.

2. Locker Ransomware

Locks users out of their devices or operating systems.

3. Scareware

Displays fake warnings or alerts claiming system infection to force payment.

4. Double Extortion Ransomware

Attackers encrypt data and threaten to leak stolen data if ransom is not paid.

How Ransomware Spreads

Ransomware attacks typically rely on social engineering and software vulnerabilities.

Phishing Emails

Malicious attachments or links

Fake urgent messages or impersonation attacks

Malicious Downloads

Software from untrusted sources

Pirated or cracked applications

Exploiting Vulnerabilities

Outdated software or operating systems

Weak or misconfigured security controls

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Attacks

Weak credentials allow attackers remote system access

Drive-by Downloads

Visiting compromised or malicious websites

Signs That a System Might Be Compromised
Suspicious Emails or Messages

Receiving unexpected messages or attachments from known or unknown sources.

Slow System Performance

Sudden device lag, frequent crashes, or unusual resource usage.

Unusual Login Activity

Login alerts from unknown devices or geographic locations.

Security Tools Disabled

Antivirus or firewall services turning off without user permission.

Unexpected File Changes

Files renamed, encrypted, or inaccessible.

Unauthorized Transactions or Messages

Banking activity or messages sent without user knowledge.

Ransomware Attack Lifecycle (High-Level)
Initial Access

Attackers gain entry using phishing, vulnerabilities, or weak credentials.

Payload Delivery

Malware is installed or executed on the victim’s system.

Data Encryption or System Locking

Files are encrypted using strong encryption algorithms.

Ransom Demand

Attackers display payment instructions and threats.

Data Exfiltration (In Advanced Attacks)

Sensitive data is stolen before encryption.

Impact of Ransomware Attacks
Data Loss

Important files or sensitive organizational data become inaccessible.

Financial Damage

Organizations suffer ransom payments, recovery costs, and operational losses.

Reputation Damage

Loss of customer trust and business credibility.

Operational Disruption

Business activities or services may be halted.

Prevention Strategies
Strong Password Practices

Use complex passwords and multi-factor authentication.

Regular Data Backup

Maintain offline and secure backup copies of important data.

Software Updates

Apply security patches and updates regularly.

Email Awareness Training

Avoid clicking unknown links or downloading suspicious attachments.

Endpoint Protection

Install and maintain updated antivirus and endpoint detection solutions.

Network Segmentation

Limit attacker movement within organizational networks.

Incident Response Steps If Infected
Disconnect from Network

Prevent ransomware from spreading to other systems.

Identify the Infection Source

Analyze entry points such as email attachments or vulnerabilities.

Preserve Evidence

Avoid deleting logs or system data useful for investigation.

Restore from Backup

Recover data using secure backup copies.

Report the Incident

Notify IT teams or cybersecurity authorities.

Ethical and Educational Importance

Studying ransomware attacks helps cybersecurity professionals:

Understand modern cyber threat techniques

Design better defensive mechanisms

Educate users about cyber awareness

Strengthen organizational security posture
