Day 29 – SQL (Structured Query Language)
1. What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and manage data in relational databases.
It works with data stored in tables consisting of rows and columns.

SQL is widely used in:

Backend development

Data analysis

Cybersecurity & forensics

Data engineering

Enterprise systems

2. Core Features of SQL
2.1 Data Querying

SQL allows users to retrieve specific data from one or multiple tables.

Fetch complete tables or selected columns

Apply conditions to limit results

Combine data from multiple tables

Example:

SELECT name, age FROM employees;

2.2 Data Manipulation (DML)

SQL supports inserting, updating, and deleting data in tables.

Operations include:

INSERT – add new records

UPDATE – modify existing records

DELETE – remove records

Examples:

INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'John', 30);
UPDATE employees SET age = 31 WHERE id = 1;
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;

2.3 Data Definition (DDL)

SQL helps define and modify database structures.

Used to:

Create tables

Modify table schema

Delete database objects

Examples:

CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  age INT
);

ALTER TABLE employees ADD salary INT;
DROP TABLE employees;

2.4 Data Control (DCL)

SQL manages user access and permissions to protect data.

Used for:

Granting privileges

Revoking access

Examples:

GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user1;
REVOKE INSERT ON employees FROM user1;

2.5 Performance Optimization

SQL improves query performance using:

Indexes

Query planning

Efficient joins

Indexes reduce search time on large datasets.

3. Uses of SQL

Database management

Data analysis and reporting

Backend application logic

Data warehousing

Security auditing and monitoring

Log analysis in cybersecurity

4. Key SQL Terms (Explained in Depth)
4.1 SELECT

Used to retrieve data from tables.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;


Example:

SELECT name, age FROM employees;


Purpose:

Fetch specific data

Read-only operation

Foundation of most SQL queries

4.2 WHERE

Filters records based on conditions.

Syntax:

SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition;


Example:

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE price > 50;


Common operators:

=, !=, >, <, >=, <=

AND, OR, NOT

4.3 JOIN

Combines rows from two or more tables using a related column.

Common JOIN types:

INNER JOIN – matching records only

LEFT JOIN – all from left table

RIGHT JOIN – all from right table

FULL JOIN – all records

Example:

SELECT customers.name, orders.amount
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;


Purpose:

Relational data access

Avoid data duplication

Build meaningful datasets

4.4 GROUP BY

Groups rows with similar values and applies aggregate functions.

Common aggregate functions:

COUNT()

SUM()

AVG()

MIN()

MAX()

Example:

SELECT status, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
GROUP BY status;


Use case:

Reports

Summaries

Analytics dashboards

4.5 INDEX

Improves query performance by speeding up data retrieval.

Example:

CREATE INDEX idx_department ON employees(department);


Key points:

Faster SELECT queries

Uses extra storage

Slows INSERT/UPDATE slightly

Best used on:

Frequently searched columns

Large tables

5. SQL in Cybersecurity Context

Detect suspicious activity from logs

Analyze failed login attempts

Monitor database access patterns

Identify data leakage and anomalies

Support forensic investigations

Example:

SELECT user, COUNT(*)
FROM login_logs
WHERE status = 'FAILED'
GROUP BY user;

6. Summary

SQL is essential for managing structured data

Core concepts include SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, and INDEX

Strong SQL fundamentals are critical for backend, data, and security roles

Performance and access control are key strengths of SQL
