Day 10 – Proxies and VPNs
Introduction

In cybersecurity, proxies and VPNs are commonly used tools for managing network traffic and protecting identity. These tools can be used by attackers to hide their origin and by investigators or security professionals to safeguard privacy. Understanding how both proxies and VPNs function is important for analyzing real-world cyber scenarios.

What is a Proxy

A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a user and the internet. Instead of connecting directly to a website, the user sends requests through the proxy server, which forwards them to the destination.

How a Proxy Works

The user sends a request to the proxy server

The proxy server forwards the request to the target website

The website responds to the proxy server

The proxy server sends the response back to the user

The target website only sees the proxy server’s IP address and not the user’s real IP address.

Uses of a Proxy

Hides the user’s IP address

Helps bypass basic network restrictions

Used for web scraping and automation

Enables content filtering

Assists in load balancing

Limitations of a Proxy

Does not encrypt data

Traffic can be monitored by the proxy provider

Not suitable for handling sensitive information

What is a VPN

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure and encrypted connection between the user’s device and the internet. All traffic is routed through a VPN server, ensuring privacy and data protection.

How a VPN Works

The user connects to a VPN server

Data is encrypted on the user’s device

Encrypted data travels through a secure tunnel

The VPN server decrypts the data and forwards it to the internet

The destination website sees the VPN server’s IP address

Advantages of a VPN

Encrypts network traffic

Protects user privacy

Secures data on public Wi-Fi

Prevents direct ISP tracking

Provides stronger security than proxies

Limitations of a VPN

Reduced speed due to encryption overhead

Free VPN services may impose data limits

VPN provider can potentially log traffic

Proxy vs VPN Comparison
Feature	Proxy	VPN
IP masking	Yes	Yes
Data encryption	No	Yes
Security level	Low	High
Performance	Faster	Slightly slower
Primary use	Basic anonymity	Privacy and security
Cybersecurity Perspective

Attackers often use proxies and VPNs to hide their identity and bypass detection. Investigators and cybersecurity professionals use these tools to protect their privacy while conducting investigations. Understanding these technologies is essential for analyzing logs, tracing attack paths, and defending networks.

Key Takeaways

Proxies hide IP addresses but do not encrypt data

VPNs hide IP addresses and encrypt traffic

VPNs offer better security than proxies

Free services should be used cautiously

Knowledge of network masking tools is essential in cybersecurity

Conclusion

Proxies and VPNs are fundamental tools in modern networking and cybersecurity. Knowing how they work and how they can be misused helps security professionals better defend systems and conduct investigations responsibly.
