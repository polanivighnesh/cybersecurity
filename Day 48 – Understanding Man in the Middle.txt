Day 48 – Understanding Man in the Middle (MITM) Attack
1. Introduction

A Man in the Middle (MITM) attack is a type of cyber attack where an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.

The attacker positions themselves between:

Client (Victim) ↔ Attacker ↔ Server

The main objective is to eavesdrop, steal sensitive data, manipulate communication, or impersonate one of the parties.

2. Why MITM Attacks Are Performed

Data Theft
Attackers attempt to capture credentials, session cookies, banking information, or personal data.

Session Hijacking
Stealing active session tokens to gain unauthorized access without knowing the password.

Financial Fraud
Modifying transaction details in banking or payment communications.

Espionage
Monitoring confidential communications in corporate or public networks.

Malware Injection
Injecting malicious scripts or files into legitimate responses.

3. How MITM Attacks Work
Step 1: Positioning Between Victim and Server

The attacker must first intercept traffic. This is usually done in local networks such as public Wi-Fi or compromised LAN environments.

Common techniques:

ARP Spoofing

DNS Spoofing

Rogue Access Points

IP Spoofing

Step 2: Traffic Interception

Once positioned, the attacker captures packets transmitted between the victim and the server.

If traffic is unencrypted (HTTP), the attacker can directly read sensitive data.

If traffic is encrypted (HTTPS), attackers may attempt:

SSL stripping

Certificate spoofing

Downgrade attacks

Step 3: Manipulation or Forwarding

The attacker can:

Forward packets without modification (passive attack).

Modify content before sending to the destination (active attack).

4. Types of MITM Attacks

ARP Spoofing
The attacker sends forged ARP responses to associate their MAC address with the IP address of the gateway.

DNS Spoofing
The attacker redirects the victim to a malicious website by poisoning DNS responses.

SSL Stripping
The attacker downgrades HTTPS connections to HTTP to capture unencrypted data.

Session Hijacking
The attacker steals session cookies to impersonate the user.

5. Tools Used in MITM (Educational / Security Research Purpose)
1. Wireshark

Purpose:

Packet capturing and network traffic analysis.

How it is used:

Capture live network packets.

Filter traffic (HTTP, DNS, TCP).

Analyze transmitted credentials or sensitive data (in unsecured networks).

Role:
Wireshark itself does not perform attacks but helps in analyzing traffic during security testing.

2. Ettercap

Purpose:

Network sniffing and MITM attack simulation.

How it is used:

Perform ARP poisoning.

Intercept and modify traffic.

Capture credentials in local networks.

Role:
Commonly used in penetration testing labs to demonstrate ARP-based MITM attacks.

3. SSLStrip

Purpose:

Downgrade HTTPS connections to HTTP.

How it is used:

Intercept HTTPS requests.

Replace secure links with HTTP.

Capture data transmitted without encryption.

Limitation:
Modern browsers implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security), reducing effectiveness.

4. ARPspoof

Purpose:

Perform ARP cache poisoning.

How it is used:

Send fake ARP replies.

Convince victim that attacker’s MAC address is the gateway.

Redirect traffic through attacker’s device.

6. Impact of MITM Attacks

Credential theft

Financial loss

Data breaches

Identity theft

Reputation damage to organizations

Compromise of confidential communications

7. How to Prevent MITM Attacks

Use HTTPS Everywhere
Ensure websites use strong TLS encryption.

Enable HSTS
Prevent downgrade attacks like SSL stripping.

Use VPN on Public Wi-Fi
Encrypt all outgoing traffic.

Implement Certificate Pinning
Prevent fake certificate attacks.

Use Secure Wi-Fi (WPA3)
Avoid open networks.

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication
Reduce impact even if credentials are stolen.

Monitor ARP Tables in Enterprise Networks
Detect abnormal ARP behavior.

8. Key Learning Outcome

Understanding how MITM attacks work helps in:

Strengthening network security

Designing secure communication systems

Identifying vulnerabilities in real-world environments

Becoming a better cybersecurity professional

Learning attacks is not about exploiting systems, but about understanding weaknesses to build stronger defenses.
