Day 20 – HTML Audio and Video Tags (Detailed Notes)
Introduction

HTML provides built-in support for multimedia through the <audio> and <video> tags. These tags allow developers to embed sound and video content directly into web pages without the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

Audio Tag
Purpose

The <audio> tag is used to embed audio content such as music, voice recordings, podcasts, and sound effects.

Basic Syntax
<audio>
    <source src="audiofile.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

Audio Attributes
Attribute	Description
controls	Displays play, pause, and volume controls
autoplay	Automatically plays audio when the page loads
loop	Replays the audio after it ends
muted	Starts audio in muted mode
preload	Defines how audio is loaded (auto, metadata, none)
Audio with Controls
<audio controls>
    <source src="song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

Autoplay and Loop Example
<audio autoplay loop muted>
    <source src="background.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

Video Tag
Purpose

The <video> tag is used to embed video content such as tutorials, product demos, lectures, and animations.

Basic Syntax
<video>
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Example
<video controls>
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
