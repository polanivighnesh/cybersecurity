OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities (2024)

The OWASP Top 10 is a regularly updated list of the most critical web application security risks. It helps developers, testers, and security professionals understand common vulnerabilities that lead to real-world data breaches.

1. Broken Access Control

Broken Access Control occurs when applications fail to properly enforce user permissions. Attackers can access unauthorized data or perform actions beyond their privileges.

Examples include users accessing admin pages, modifying other users’ data, or bypassing authorization checks.

Impact:

Unauthorized data access

Privilege escalation

Account takeover

2. Cryptographic Failures

Cryptographic Failures happen when sensitive data is not properly protected using encryption or secure cryptographic practices.

This includes weak encryption algorithms, improper key management, or storing sensitive data in plaintext.

Impact:

Exposure of sensitive data

Data breaches

Loss of confidentiality

3. Injection

Injection vulnerabilities occur when untrusted input is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, such as SQL, NoSQL, or OS commands.

Attackers can manipulate queries to read, modify, or delete data.

Impact:

Unauthorized database access

Data manipulation or loss

Remote code execution

4. Insecure Design

Insecure Design refers to weaknesses in application architecture and design decisions that make applications inherently vulnerable.

These issues cannot be fixed by simple patches and require redesigning secure workflows.

Impact:

Business logic abuse

System compromise

Long-term security risks

5. Security Misconfiguration

Security Misconfiguration occurs when applications, servers, or cloud services are not securely configured.

Examples include default credentials, unnecessary services enabled, or missing security headers.

Impact:

System compromise

Unauthorized access

Increased attack surface

6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Using libraries, frameworks, or software components with known vulnerabilities can expose applications to attacks.

This often happens when components are not regularly updated or monitored.

Impact:

Exploitation of known vulnerabilities

System compromise

Supply chain attacks

7. Identification and Authentication Failures

These failures occur when authentication mechanisms are poorly implemented.

Examples include weak passwords, improper session handling, or missing multi-factor authentication.

Impact:

Account takeover

Credential stuffing attacks

Unauthorized access

8. Software and Data Integrity Failures

This vulnerability arises when applications rely on untrusted software updates, plugins, or CI/CD pipelines without proper integrity checks.

Attackers can inject malicious code into trusted systems.

Impact:

Malware injection

Unauthorized code execution

Data manipulation

9. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

SSRF occurs when an application fetches remote resources without validating user-supplied URLs.

Attackers can force the server to access internal services or sensitive endpoints.

Impact:

Access to internal systems

Data leakage

Cloud metadata exposure

10. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

When applications fail to log and monitor security events properly, attacks can go undetected for long periods.

This delays incident response and increases damage.

Impact:

Undetected breaches

Delayed incident response

Increased business impact

Conclusion

Understanding the OWASP Top 10 is essential for building secure web applications.
Addressing these vulnerabilities early helps reduce security risks and prevents real-world data breaches.
