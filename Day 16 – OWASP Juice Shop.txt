Day 16 – OWASP Juice Shop
Overview

OWASP Juice Shop is a deliberately vulnerable web application created to demonstrate modern web application security issues. It is designed to help learners understand how real-world applications fail due to poor design and insecure implementation.

Objective

To understand common security issues in modern web applications

To practice identifying vulnerabilities in a safe environment

To develop an attacker’s mindset and improve defensive thinking

Key Vulnerabilities Learned
Logic Flaws

Logic flaws occur when application workflows are poorly designed. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses without breaking authentication mechanisms. Such flaws allow users to bypass steps, misuse features, or gain unintended advantages.

Insecure Authentication

Insecure authentication includes weak login mechanisms, poor password policies, improper session handling, and missing security controls such as rate limiting. These weaknesses can allow unauthorized access to user accounts.

Improper Input Validation

Improper input validation happens when user inputs are not properly checked or sanitized. This can lead to injection attacks and unexpected application behavior, allowing attackers to manipulate requests or data.

Uses of OWASP Juice Shop

Used for learning modern web application security concepts

Helps practice real-world vulnerability exploitation safely

Useful for penetration testing training

Creates awareness about secure coding and application design

Aligns with common web security standards and practices

Key Takeaways

Application security depends on both code and logic design

Authentication systems must be properly implemented and protected

Input validation is critical to prevent manipulation

Practical labs provide better understanding than theory alone

Thinking like an attacker helps in building secure applications

Conclusion

OWASP Juice Shop is an effective learning platform for understanding how modern web applications fail due to logical and security weaknesses. It provides hands-on experience that strengthens both offensive and defensive security knowledge.
