Day 56 – Cryptographic Failures
Data Exposure Due to Weak or Missing Encryption
Introduction

Cryptographic failures occur when sensitive data is not properly protected through secure encryption mechanisms. These failures can expose confidential information such as passwords, financial data, API keys, personal records, and business secrets.

Unlike active attacks (like SQL Injection or XSS), cryptographic failures often result from misconfiguration, outdated algorithms, improper key management, or complete absence of encryption.

This vulnerability is recognized in the OWASP Top 10 under Cryptographic Failures.

What is Encryption?

Encryption is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into unreadable data (ciphertext) using mathematical algorithms and cryptographic keys.

Only authorized parties with the correct key can decrypt and access the original data.

Encryption protects:

Data in transit (e.g., HTTPS communication)

Data at rest (e.g., database storage)

Data in processing (advanced secure environments)

Types of Cryptography
1. Symmetric Encryption

Uses the same key for encryption and decryption.

Fast and efficient.

Example: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

2. Asymmetric Encryption

Uses a public key and private key pair.

Used in secure communications and digital signatures.

Example: RSA, ECC

3. Hashing

One-way function.

Used to store passwords securely.

Example: bcrypt, Argon2

Common Causes of Cryptographic Failures
1. Weak Algorithms

Using outdated algorithms like:

MD5

SHA1

DES

These algorithms are vulnerable to collision and brute-force attacks.

2. Storing Passwords in Plaintext

If a database is compromised, attackers gain immediate access to user credentials.

3. Missing HTTPS (No TLS)

Without TLS, attackers can intercept data via:

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks

Packet sniffing

4. Hardcoded Cryptographic Keys

Embedding secret keys directly in source code makes them easy to extract.

5. Improper Certificate Validation

Accepting invalid or self-signed certificates without verification increases attack surface.

6. No Encryption for Data at Rest

Sensitive database fields stored without encryption can be exposed during breaches.

Real-World Impact

Cryptographic failures can result in:

Massive data breaches

Identity theft

Financial fraud

Regulatory penalties (GDPR, HIPAA violations)

Reputational damage

Loss of customer trust

Example consequences seen in breaches affecting companies like
Equifax and Yahoo involved improper data protection mechanisms.

How Encryption Works (Technical Overview)

User sends data to server.

TLS establishes a secure handshake.

Session keys are generated.

Data is encrypted before transmission.

Server decrypts using appropriate keys.

For stored passwords:

User enters password.

Password is hashed using bcrypt/Argon2.

Hash is stored (not the actual password).

During login, entered password is hashed again and compared.

Conclusion

Cryptographic security is not optional in modern software development.
It is a foundational requirement for protecting confidentiality, integrity, and trust.

Weak or missing encryption turns even the most advanced applications into vulnerable systems.

Security is not just about preventing attacks.
It is about ensuring data remains protected at every stage — in transit, at rest, and during processing.
