Day 26 – Functions, Conditions and Loops in PHP
Introduction

PHP is a server-side scripting language used to build dynamic web applications.
Functions, conditions, and loops form the core logic of PHP programs. These concepts help in controlling the flow of execution, reducing code repetition, and writing efficient and maintainable code.

Functions in PHP
What is a Function?

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It executes only when it is called.

Why Functions are Important

Avoids repeating the same code

Improves readability

Makes debugging easier

Encourages modular programming

Types of Functions in PHP
Built-in Functions

These are predefined functions provided by PHP.

Example:

echo strlen("Hello World");
echo strtoupper("php");
echo date("Y-m-d");

User-Defined Functions

These functions are created by the developer to perform custom tasks.

Syntax:

function functionName($parameter) {
    // code
    return $value;
}


Example:

function greet($name) {
    return "Hello " . $name;
}

echo greet("Virat");

Function with Default Parameters
function welcome($user = "Guest") {
    echo "Welcome " . $user;
}

welcome();

Function Use Case

Functions are commonly used for validation, authentication, data processing, and formatting outputs.

Conditional Statements in PHP
What is a Condition?

Conditions are used to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

Types of Conditional Statements
if Statement
if ($age >= 18) {
    echo "Eligible to vote";
}

if–else Statement
if ($marks >= 40) {
    echo "Pass";
} else {
    echo "Fail";
}

if–elseif–else Statement
if ($score >= 90) {
    echo "Grade A";
} elseif ($score >= 75) {
    echo "Grade B";
} else {
    echo "Grade C";
}

switch Statement
$day = "Monday";

switch ($day) {
    case "Monday":
        echo "Start of the week";
        break;
    case "Friday":
        echo "Weekend approaching";
        break;
    default:
        echo "Regular day";
}

Conditional Use Case

Conditions are widely used for user authentication, access control, input validation, and decision-making logic.

Loops in PHP
What is a Loop?

A loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition becomes false.

Types of Loops
for Loop

Used when the number of iterations is known.

for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
    echo $i;
}

while Loop

Executes code as long as the condition is true.

$i = 1;
while ($i <= 5) {
    echo $i;
    $i++;
}

do–while Loop

Executes the code at least once before checking the condition.

$i = 1;
do {
    echo $i;
    $i++;
} while ($i <= 5);

foreach Loop

Used specifically for arrays.

$colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"];

foreach ($colors as $color) {
    echo $color;
}

Loop Use Case

Loops are commonly used for displaying database records, processing arrays, handling user input, and log analysis.

Comparison Summary
Concept	Purpose
Function	Reuse code
Condition	Decision making
Loop	Repeat execution
Best Practices

Use functions for reusable logic

Avoid infinite loops

Always validate user input

Keep code simple and readable

Conclusion

Functions, conditions, and loops are the foundation of PHP programming. Mastering these concepts is essential for backend development, secure applications, and further learning in frameworks and cybersecurity.
