Day 36 – Cryptography Basics: Outdated vs Secure Encryption
Introduction

Cryptography is a core concept in cybersecurity used to protect data from unauthorized access. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation of information. However, using weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms can compromise data security and lead to serious vulnerabilities.

What is Cryptography?

Cryptography is the process of securing information by transforming readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using mathematical algorithms and keys. Only authorized parties with the correct key can access the original data.

Cryptography is commonly used in:

Secure web communication (HTTPS)

Password storage

Online banking and digital payments

Cloud data protection

Secure file storage and transmission

How Cryptography Works

The basic cryptographic process involves the following steps:

Plaintext: Original readable data

Encryption Algorithm: Converts plaintext into ciphertext

Cryptographic Key: Controls the encryption and decryption process

Ciphertext: Encrypted unreadable data

Decryption: Converts ciphertext back into plaintext using the correct key

This process ensures that data remains protected during storage and transmission.

Outdated Cryptography

Outdated cryptographic algorithms are no longer considered secure due to advancements in computing power and cryptanalysis techniques.

Examples of Outdated Algorithms

MD5

Broken hashing algorithm

Vulnerable to collision attacks

SHA-1

Collision attacks have been demonstrated

DES (56-bit)

Small key size makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks

RC4

Design flaws and statistical weaknesses

RSA with key sizes less than 2048 bits

Can be brute-forced using modern hardware

Risks of Outdated Cryptography

Passwords can be cracked easily

Sensitive data can be exposed

Man-in-the-middle attacks become possible

Non-compliance with security standards such as GDPR and PCI-DSS

False sense of security in applications

Modern Cryptography

Modern cryptographic algorithms are designed to resist known attacks and are recommended for secure systems.

Examples of Secure Algorithms

AES-256

Strong symmetric encryption standard

RSA-2048 or RSA-4096

Secure asymmetric encryption

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

Strong security with smaller key sizes

SHA-256 and SHA-3

Secure hashing algorithms

bcrypt and Argon2

Secure password hashing algorithms

TLS 1.3

Latest secure protocol for web communication

Benefits of Modern Cryptography

High resistance to brute-force and cryptographic attacks

Secure data storage and transmission

Compliance with modern security standards

Widely adopted by enterprises and governments

Comparison: Outdated vs Modern Cryptography

Outdated cryptography relies on weak algorithms and small key sizes, making systems vulnerable to attacks.
Modern cryptography uses strong algorithms, large key sizes, and secure protocols to protect sensitive data effectively.

Real-World Applications of Modern Cryptography
