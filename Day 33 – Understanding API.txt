Day 33 – Understanding API and How It Works
1. What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and definitions that allows one software application to communicate with another.
Instead of accessing a database or service directly, applications interact through APIs to request data or trigger actions.

APIs act as an intermediary layer between:

Client (browser, mobile app, frontend)

Server (backend logic, database, services)

This separation improves security, scalability, and maintainability.

2. Why APIs Are Needed

To allow different applications to communicate

To expose specific functionalities without revealing internal logic

To support multi-platform access (web, mobile, IoT)

To enable automation and integration between services

To build scalable and modular systems

3. How an API Works (Request–Response Flow)

Client Request

The client sends a request to an API endpoint

Includes method, headers, parameters, and sometimes a body

API Processing

The API validates the request

Applies authentication and authorization

Executes business logic

Server / Database Interaction

API interacts with database or other services

Fetches, updates, or deletes data

Response Returned

Server sends response back through the API

Usually in JSON or XML format

Includes status codes and data

4. Core API Components
4.1 Endpoint

A specific URL that represents a resource or action.

Example:

GET /api/users
POST /api/login

4.2 HTTP Methods

Define the type of operation being performed:

GET → Retrieve data

POST → Send or create data

PUT → Update existing data

DELETE → Remove data

4.3 Request

Contains:

URL

Method

Headers (Content-Type, Authorization)

Parameters (query/path)

Body (for POST/PUT)

4.4 Response

Contains:

Status code

Headers

Response body (data or message)

Common status codes:

200 → OK

201 → Created

400 → Bad Request

401 → Unauthorized

403 → Forbidden

404 → Not Found

500 → Internal Server Error

5. Types of APIs
5.1 REST API

Most commonly used

Stateless

Uses HTTP methods

Data usually in JSON

5.2 SOAP API

Uses XML

More rigid and secure

Mostly used in enterprise systems

5.3 Internal APIs

Used within an organization

Not publicly exposed

5.4 Public APIs

Accessible to external developers

Often require API keys or tokens

6. Authentication & Authorization in APIs

API Keys – Simple identification

Bearer Tokens – Temporary access tokens

OAuth – Secure delegated access

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) – Stateless authentication

Purpose:

Prevent unauthorized access

Control what users can do

Protect backend resources

7. API Security Considerations

Common risks:

Broken authentication

Excessive data exposure

Lack of rate limiting

Improper input validation

Basic protections:

Authentication & authorization

Input validation

HTTPS

Rate limiting

Logging and monitoring

8. Real-World Example

A food delivery app:

Mobile app → sends request to API

API → fetches restaurant data from database

API → returns menu details to client

User places order → API processes payment and order flow

9. Benefits of Using APIs

Loose coupling between systems

Reusability of services

Platform independence

Faster development

Easier maintenance and scaling

10. Key Takeaways

APIs are the backbone of modern applications

They enable secure and structured communication

Understanding APIs is essential for backend, frontend, and security roles

APIs must be designed with performance and security in mind
