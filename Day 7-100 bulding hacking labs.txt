Day 7 – Building an Ethical Hacking Lab
Installing Kali Linux and Parrot OS (Step by Step)

Ethical hacking is practiced in controlled environments.
Instead of attacking real systems, professionals build isolated labs using virtual machines to learn safely and legally.

Lab Architecture

Host System
The main operating system running on the physical machine (Windows, Linux, or macOS).

Virtual Machines
Kali Linux – Attacker system
Parrot OS – Attacker or security-focused system
Vulnerable Machine – Victim system (optional)

Hypervisor
VirtualBox or VMware used to run multiple operating systems.

Prerequisites

Minimum 8 GB RAM (16 GB recommended)
At least 60 GB free disk space
Virtualization enabled in BIOS (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)
Stable internet connection

Step 1: Install VirtualBox

Download VirtualBox from the official website.
Install it using default settings.
Download and install the VirtualBox Extension Pack of the same version.

VirtualBox allows multiple operating systems to run safely on a single host machine.

Step 2: Download Kali Linux

Visit the official Kali Linux website.
Navigate to Downloads and select the VirtualBox image.
Download the .ova file.

Step 3: Install Kali Linux in VirtualBox

Open VirtualBox.
Click File and select Import Appliance.
Choose the Kali Linux .ova file.
Allocate system resources:
RAM: 4 GB
CPU: 2 cores
Click Import and wait for completion.

Default login credentials:
Username: kali
Password: kali

Step 4: Download Parrot OS

Visit the official Parrot OS website.
Select Parrot Security Edition for VirtualBox.
Download the .ova file.

Step 5: Install Parrot OS

Open VirtualBox.
Click Import Appliance.
Select the Parrot OS .ova file.
Allocate resources:
RAM: 4 GB
CPU: 2 cores
Import and start the virtual machine.

Step 6: Network Configuration

Open VirtualBox settings for each virtual machine.
Set Network Adapter to one of the following:

NAT mode for beginners and safer internet access
Internal Network for isolated lab environments

Do not expose vulnerable machines to public networks.

Step 7: Add a Vulnerable Victim Machine (Optional)

Install intentionally vulnerable systems such as:
Metasploitable
DVWA
OWASP Broken Web Applications

These systems are used only for practice and learning.

Common Tools Available in Kali and Parrot OS

Nmap
Metasploit
Burp Suite
Wireshark
Hydra
SQLmap

These tools must be used only in authorized environments.

Legal and Ethical Considerations

Never attack systems without explicit permission.
Use labs or authorized targets only.
Ethical hacking requires consent, responsibility, and documentation.

Learning Outcome

Ability to build a legal hacking environment
Hands-on understanding of attacker techniques
Improved defensive thinking
Preparation for real-world security roles

Conclusion

This lab setup reflects how security researchers, penetration testers, SOC analysts, and ethical hackers practice in real-world scenarios.
