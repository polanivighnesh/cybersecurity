The Internet and Submarine Cables
Introduction

The Internet is a global system that allows computers and devices around the world to communicate. Most people think the Internet is wireless, but over 95 percent of global data travels through underwater submarine cables.

What Is the Internet

The Internet is a global network of computers connected using cables, satellites, routers, and servers. It is used to send data such as emails, websites, videos, and messages.

The Internet works using protocols, mainly TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol).

Who Invented the Internet

The Internet was not invented by one person.

Key contributors include:

Vinton Cerf, co-inventor of TCP/IP

Robert Kahn, co-inventor of TCP/IP

ARPANET (1969), the first working version of the Internet, developed by the United States Department of Defense

Vinton Cerf is often called the father of the Internet.

What Are Submarine Cables

Submarine cables are fiber-optic cables laid under oceans and seas to connect continents.

They carry:

Internet data

Phone calls

Video streaming

Financial transactions

Who Invented Submarine Cables

Early history:

In 1858, the first transatlantic telegraph cable was created

It was led by Cyrus West Field

Modern Internet cables:

Use fiber-optic technology

Developed during the 1970s and 1980s

Based on research by scientists such as Charles K. Kao, a pioneer of fiber optics

How Submarine Cables Work

Data is converted into light signals

Light travels through fiber-optic glass

Repeaters boost the signal every 50 to 100 kilometers

Data reaches another continent in milliseconds

Example:
India ----- Europe ----- USA

Why Submarine Cables Are Important

Submarine cables are:

Faster than satellites

More reliable

Lower cost

They are essential for cloud services, online gaming, video calls, and global trade.

Risks and Protection

Submarine cables can be damaged by earthquakes, fishing nets, and ship anchors.

They are protected through international laws, deep-sea placement, and constant monitoring.

Interesting Facts

More than 500 submarine cables exist worldwide

Some cables are longer than 20,000 kilometers

Companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft own submarine cables

Conclusion

The Internet depends heavily on physical infrastructure, especially submarine cables. Without them, global communication would be slow, unreliable, or impossible.
