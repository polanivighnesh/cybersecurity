Day 52 – Firewalls, Network Traffic, NAT, and DDoS Attacks

Introduction

Understanding firewalls, traffic control, Network Address Translation (NAT), and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is fundamental in cybersecurity and network defense. These concepts form the backbone of how modern networks operate securely and how attackers attempt to disrupt services.

Firewall

Definition

A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security policies. It acts as a boundary between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network such as the Internet.

Core Purpose

The main objective of a firewall is to prevent unauthorized access while allowing legitimate communication. It enforces access control rules that define what traffic is permitted or denied.

How Firewalls Work

When a data packet enters or leaves a network, the firewall inspects the packet header and sometimes the payload. It evaluates parameters such as:

Source IP address

Destination IP address

Source and destination port numbers

Protocol type (TCP, UDP, ICMP)

Connection state

Based on configured rules, the firewall performs one of the following actions:

Allow the packet

Deny the packet

Log the event

Drop the packet silently

Types of Firewalls

Packet Filtering Firewall
Operates at the network layer. Filters traffic based on IP addresses and port numbers. It is fast but lacks deep inspection.

Stateful Inspection Firewall
Tracks the state of active connections. It allows packets that are part of an established session, making it more secure than simple packet filtering.

Proxy Firewall
Acts as an intermediary between client and server. It hides internal IP addresses and can inspect application-layer traffic.

Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
Provides deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention, application awareness, and advanced threat detection.

Firewall and Traffic Types

Legitimate Traffic
This includes normal user requests such as browsing websites, sending emails, accessing cloud services, and authenticated application communication.

Malicious Traffic
This includes exploit attempts, malware communication, port scanning, brute-force login attempts, and unauthorized access requests.

A properly configured firewall significantly reduces attack surface by blocking malicious traffic before it reaches internal systems.

Network Address Translation (NAT)

Definition

Network Address Translation is a method used by routers to translate private IP addresses within a local network into a public IP address before packets are sent to the Internet.

Why NAT is Necessary

IPv4 address space is limited. NAT allows multiple devices in a private network to share a single public IP address. It also adds an additional layer of obscurity by hiding internal IP addresses from external networks.

Private vs Public IP Addresses

Private IP addresses are used within local networks and are not routable on the Internet. Common private IP ranges include:

10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255

172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255

192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

Public IP addresses are globally unique and assigned by Internet Service Providers.

How NAT Works

When a device inside a network sends a request to an external server:

The device sends a packet with its private IP address.

The router performing NAT replaces the private IP with its public IP.

The external server responds to the public IP.

The router translates the public IP back to the original private IP and forwards the response to the correct device.

This translation process maintains a mapping table to ensure responses reach the correct internal device.

Types of NAT

Static NAT
One-to-one mapping between a private IP and a public IP. Often used for hosting internal servers accessible from the Internet.

Dynamic NAT
Maps private IP addresses to a pool of public IP addresses dynamically.

Port Address Translation (PAT)
Also called NAT Overload. Multiple private IP addresses share a single public IP using different port numbers. This is the most common implementation in home and enterprise networks.

Security Perspective of NAT

NAT provides basic network hiding but should not be considered a full security solution. It does not replace a firewall. However, it reduces direct exposure of internal systems to the Internet.

DDoS Attack (Distributed Denial of Service)

Definition

A Distributed Denial of Service attack is a cyberattack in which multiple compromised systems flood a target server, network, or application with excessive traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

Objective of a DDoS Attack

The goal is not to steal data but to disrupt services by exhausting system resources such as bandwidth, CPU, memory, or connection tables.

How DDoS Attacks Work

An attacker infects multiple devices with malware.

These compromised devices form a botnet.

The attacker commands the botnet to send massive traffic to a target.

The target server becomes overwhelmed and cannot process legitimate requests.

Impact of DDoS Attacks

Service downtime

Financial losses

Damage to brand reputation

Loss of customer trust

Operational disruption

Types of DDoS Attacks

Volumetric Attacks
These consume bandwidth by sending large amounts of traffic. Example: UDP flood.

Protocol Attacks
These exploit weaknesses in network protocols to exhaust server resources. Example: SYN flood.

Application Layer Attacks
These target specific applications or services. Example: HTTP flood, where repeated requests overload a web server.

Detection and Mitigation

DDoS mitigation strategies include:

Rate limiting

Web Application Firewalls

Load balancing

Content Delivery Networks

Traffic filtering and anomaly detection

Dedicated DDoS protection services

Modern security architecture combines firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and real-time traffic analysis to detect abnormal traffic patterns early.

Relationship Between Firewall, NAT, and DDoS

Firewalls control traffic based on rules and block malicious packets.
NAT translates internal IP addresses and enables Internet communication.
DDoS attacks attempt to overwhelm systems despite these protections.

A well-configured firewall can filter suspicious traffic, and advanced firewalls can detect DDoS patterns. NAT helps structure communication but must be combined with proper security controls.

Conclusion

Firewalls provide traffic control and enforce security policies.
NAT enables communication between private networks and the Internet while conserving IP addresses.
DDoS attacks represent a major threat to availability by overwhelming systems with distributed traffic.

A strong understanding of these concepts is essential for network security professionals, system administrators, and cybersecurity engineers. These are foundational building blocks for advanced topics such as intrusion detection, zero trust architecture, and cloud security.
